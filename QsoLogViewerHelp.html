<H1 CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4>Introduction</FONT></H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ham radio operators use a number of
different databases to manage their contacts, or QSOs. Many are
web-hosted sites that are viewed by other hams and grant awards for
achieving milestones such as all states contacted. Among these
web-hosted sites three are quite popular, <A HREF="https://www.eqsl.cc/">eqsl.cc</A>,
<A HREF="https://www.qrz.com/index.html">qrz.com</A> and
<A HREF="https://lotw.arrl.org/lotwuser/qsos">lotw.arrl.org</A> .
Operators generally use a PC based logging program, such as Ham Radio
Deluxe (hrd) Logbook, N1MM Logger, Winlog32 or other programs to
record their QSOs as they complete their contacts. Periodically hams
export their recent QSOs to a standard file and upload it to one or
more web-hosted sites.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Over time the web-hosted sites and the
local logger(s) become inconsistent. Some of the reasons
inconsistencies occur are:</P>
<UL>
	<UL>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">hams forget to upload all of
		their QSOs</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">QSOs are uploaded twice. These
		duplicates should be caught by the logging site but they are not
		always discovered.</P>
		<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">an operator has their clock
		improperly set to UTC. When the contacted operator upload their QSO
		log entry the two will not match, and a duplicate may be created.</P>
	</UL>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">QsoLogViewer is an application for
aiding operators in finding duplicate QSOs and missing QSOs in these
different repositories. Once duplicates are identified operator can
use the edit features of the logbook to delete or correct those
records. QsoLogViewer can also prepare an update file for missing
QSOs so the operator can upload them into the correct logbook.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4>Important Note</FONT></H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3><U>QsoLogViewer is not an
editor</U>. You cannot edit your logbook database directly from the
tables created by QsoLogViewer. Every logbook has different fields
and conventions for assigning values to fields and storing them. Use
QsoLogViewer to find duplicates and then correct them with the
logbook tools.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>QsoLogViewer can create
difference files, that is a file that contains QSOs that exist in one
logbook but are not found in another. That file can then be uploaded
into the incomplete logbook and thereby synchronize the two logbooks.
<U>Use this feature with care.</U> If you upload an incorrect
difference file or load it into the wrong logbook you run the risk of
creating a large number of duplicates.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>QsoLogViewer does not
operate directly on logbook databases, only on analyzes files
downloaded from those logbooks. So QsoLogViewe can't corrupt the
logbook database or induce errors in the logs unless you upload an
invalid file.</FONT></P>
<H1 CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4>Using QsoLogViewer</FONT></H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The following steps enable
you to eliminate duplicate records and enter missing records into you
logbooks.</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4>Step 1 - Create a directory with
downloaded AID files</FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>You probably have multiple
logbook databases, so create a new directory (folder) that will
contain files from all logbooks you want to synchromize. I'll call
that directory myLogs. Visit each web-hosted logbook and export
(download) a complete file of your QSOs in ADI format. Make sure you
download QSOs and not QSLs or you'll be missing a lot of records.
ADIF is a standard for Amateur Digital Information Format. The other
popular format, Cabrillo, is not supported by QsoLogViewer at this
time. Use the export feature of your PC based logbook program to
export a complete record of those databases to the same directory.
Name the files to indicate where they came from. After downloading my
directory had the following files:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">                                       
                <FONT SIZE=3>qrz.adi     eqsl.adi     lotw.adi    
hrd.adi</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4>Step 2 - Load and View an AID file</FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Select the first file you
want to analyze. We'll use eqsl.adi in this example. Load the file
using the menu items: File-&gt;Open. A file chooser dialog will let
you select the file, eqsl.adi in our example. Once loaded you should
see a table similar to the one below:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="QsoLogViewerHelp_html_m6f219c65.png" NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=518 HEIGHT=377 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>The
table lists QSO records in the order received in the downloaded file.
You can sort the records by clicking on the column headings. So to
reorder the records by call sign click on the 'CALL' heading.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>The columns shown when
first opening the file are set by default to the ones shown above.
You can modify the columns you'd like to see by selecting the
Action-&gt;Edit Columns men item. You'll see a dialog similar to the
one below.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="QsoLogViewerHelp_html_m7be77f02.png" NAME="graphics2" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=263 HEIGHT=528 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>You
can hide a column by unchecking it, or show a column by checking it.
The underlying QSO records are unaffected. Only the table view is
affected.</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4>Step 3 - Find Duplicates</FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>To find duplicates in the
adif file select the Action-&gt;Find Duplicates menu item. A dialog
similar to the one below will appear.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="QsoLogViewerHelp_html_2183b07c.png" NAME="graphics3" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=363 HEIGHT=119 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Click
OK and you will be taken back to the table. However now duplicate
records are selected (highlighted). You can view only the duplicates
by selecting the menu item View-&gt;Show Selected Records. Then the
table will only show an updated list of selected records similar to
the following.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="QsoLogViewerHelp_html_m4e060a1.png" NAME="graphics4" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=522 HEIGHT=380 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>In
this example I clicked on the CALL header in the table to sort them
by call sign. At this point you should log into your web-hosted or
local logbook and delete the duplicate records. You may want to
delete those records not acknowledged by the other operator, when
possible.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
<FONT SIZE=3>Once you've corrected the source logbook you can
download a revised AIDF file if the changes are extensive. That will
prepare you for the next step, identifying missing records. Note that
when you are only viewing selected records the QsoLogViewer title bar
will include the term '- Updated List -'. This tells you that you are
looking at selected records. To return to a view of the entire file
use the <BR>View-&gt;Show All Rows menu item.</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4>Step 4 - Find and Upload Missing
Records</FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>To find duplicates in an
adif file begin by opening the file you consider most complete with
the</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>File-&gt;Open menu item.
Then select the Action-&gt;Compare Files menu item. The file chooser
menu will appear asking which file you want to compare to the open
ADIF file. You may get a warning about duplicate records, but you can
hit OK to continue. You should then see a dialog similar to the one
below.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="QsoLogViewerHelp_html_m422eeb52.png" NAME="graphics5" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=469 HEIGHT=198 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>In this example eight
missing records were found. The eight records are in the open file,
qrz.adi, but not in the compare file, eqsl.adi. After you hit the OK
button you'll be returned to the main table, showing qrz.adi in this
example. At that point you will probably want to see only selected
(highlighted) records. To see them use the View-&gt;Show Selected
Rows menu item. You should see something like the following.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="QsoLogViewerHelp_html_5efd77a.png" NAME="graphics6" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=519 HEIGHT=380 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><FONT SIZE=3>Look
these records over and identify any you consider invalid and edit
those out by selecting them (Cntrl+left click) and then using the
menu item Edit-&gt;Delete. This action only deletes them from the
Update List table; it does not affect the AIDF file or any logbook.
You can now create an update file by selecting the File-&gt;Save menu
item. I use the naming convention eqsl_update.adi so I am careful to
only upload updates, not entire logbook AIDF files.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>Once you have eliminated
duplicates and uploaded missing files your logbooks should be
synchronized.</FONT></P>
<H1 CLASS="western"><FONT SIZE=4>Additional Menu Items</FONT></H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=3>In addition to the menu
items already covered, there are two that may be helpful.</FONT></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Header Menu Item</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">After opening a file use the View-&gt;File
Header menu item to display the opened AIDF file's meta data. While
this can vary, it generally displays which logbook created the file,
when it was created and which version of the AIDF standard it
complies with. It will look something like the following.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="QsoLogViewerHelp_html_m5cf627fe.png" NAME="graphics7" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=334 HEIGHT=180 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Comparison Rules Menu Item</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Qso log records are compared when
searching for duplicates and when two logbook AIDF files are
compared. By default QsoLogViewer looks for matches using Call Sign,
Band, Qso Date and Qso Time On (the UTC time the Qso started). In
using Qso Time On two times are considered identical if they are
within a default of 5 minutes of each other. Users can change these
criteria using the Action-&gt;Show Rules menu item. When selecting
this menu item you will see the dialog below.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><IMG SRC="QsoLogViewerHelp_html_6df0021a.png" NAME="graphics8" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=267 HEIGHT=447 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When using these fields QsoLogViewer
ignores case, so the call sign KC1ATT matches with the call sign
kc1att.
