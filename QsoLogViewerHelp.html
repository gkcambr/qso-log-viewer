        <h1 class="western"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Introduction</font></h1>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Ham radio operators use a number of
            different databases to manage their contacts, or QSOs. Many are
            web-hosted sites that are viewed by other hams and grant awards for
            achieving milestones such as all states contacted. Among these
            web-hosted sites three are quite popular, <a href="https://www.eqsl.cc/">eqsl.cc</a>,
            <a href="https://www.qrz.com/index.html">qrz.com</a> and
            <a href="https://lotw.arrl.org/lotwuser/qsos">lotw.arrl.org</a> .
            Operators generally use a PC based logging program, such as Ham Radio
            Deluxe (hrd) Logbook, N1MM Logger, Winlog32 or other programs to
            record their QSOs as they complete their contacts. Periodically hams
            export their recent QSOs to a standard file and upload it to one or
            more web-hosted sites.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Over time the web-hosted sites and the
            local logger(s) become inconsistent. Some of the reasons
            inconsistencies occur are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li/>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">hams forget to upload all of
                their QSOs</p>
            <li/>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">QSOs are uploaded twice. These
                duplicates should be caught by the logging site but they are not
                always discovered.</p>
            <li/>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">an operator has their clock
                improperly set to UTC. When the contacted operator upload their QSO
                log entry the two will not match, and a duplicate may be created.</p>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">QsoLogViewer is an application for
            aiding operators in finding duplicate QSOs and missing QSOs in these
            different repositories. Once duplicates are identified operator can
            use the edit features of the logbook to delete or correct those
            records. QsoLogViewer can also prepare an update file for missing
            QSOs so the operator can upload them into the correct logbook.</p>
        <h1 class="western"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Important
                Note</font></h1>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><u>QsoLogViewer
                    is not an editor</u>. You cannot edit your logbook database directly
                from the tables created by QsoLogViewer. Every logbook has different
                fields and conventions for assigning values to fields and storing
                them. Use QsoLogViewer to find duplicates and then correct them with
                the logbook tools.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">QsoLogViewer
                can create difference files, that is a file that contains QSOs that
                exist in one logbook but are not found in another. That file can then
                be uploaded into the incomplete logbook and thereby synchronize the
                two logbooks. <u>Use this feature with care.</u> If you upload an
                incorrect difference file or load it into the wrong logbook you run
                the risk of creating a large number of duplicates.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">QsoLogViewer
                does not operate directly on logbook databases, only on analyzes
                files downloaded from those logbooks. So QsoLogViewe can't corrupt
                the logbook database or induce errors in the logs unless you upload
                an invalid file.</font></p>
        <h1 class="western"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Using
                QsoLogViewer</font></h1>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
                following steps enable you to eliminate duplicate records and enter
                missing records into you logbooks.</font></p>
        <h2 class="western"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Step 1 -
                Create a directory with downloaded AID files</font></h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">You
                probably have multiple logbook databases, so create a new directory
                (folder) that will contain files from all logbooks you want to
                synchromize. I'll call that directory myLogs. Visit each web-hosted
                logbook and export (download) a complete file of your QSOs in ADI
                format. Make sure you download QSOs and not QSLs or you'll be missing
                a lot of records. ADIF is a standard for Amateur Digital Information
                Format. The other popular format, Cabrillo, is not supported by
                QsoLogViewer at this time. Use the export feature of your PC based
                logbook program to export a complete record of those databases to the
                same directory. Name the files to indicate where they came from.
                After downloading my directory had the following files:</font></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">qrz.adi
                eqsl.adi lotw.adi hrd.adi</font></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

        </p>
        <h2 class="western"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Step 2 -
                Load and View an AID file</font></h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Select
                the first file you want to analyze. We'll use eqsl.adi in this
                example. Load the file using the menu items: File-&gt;Open. A file
                chooser dialog will let you select the file, eqsl.adi in our example.
                Once loaded you should see a table similar to the one below:</font></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="images/FileLoad.png" name="graphics1" alt="see images in QsoLogViewerHelp.html" align="left" width="518" height="377">
            <br clear="left"/>
            <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
                table lists QSO records in the order received in the downloaded file.
                You can sort the records by clicking on the column headings. So to
                reorder the records by call sign click on the 'CALL' heading.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
                columns shown when first opening the file are set by default to the
                ones shown above. You can modify the columns you'd like to see by
                selecting the Action-&gt;Edit Columns men item. You'll see a dialog
                similar to the one below.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="images/EditColumns.png" name="graphics2" alt="see images in QsoLogViewerHelp.html" align="left" width="263" height="528">
            <br clear="left"/>
            <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">You
                can hide a column by unchecking it, or show a column by checking it.
                The underlying QSO records are unaffected. Only the table view is
                affected.</font></p>
        <h2 class="western"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Step 3 -
                Find Duplicates</font></h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">To
                find duplicates in the adif file select the Action-&gt;Find
                Duplicates menu item. A dialog similar to the one below will appear.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="images/DuplicatesFound.png" name="graphics3" alt="see images in QsoLogViewerHelp.html" align="left" width="363" height="119">
            <br clear="left"/>
            <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Click
                OK and you will be taken back to the table. However now duplicate
                records are selected (highlighted). You can view only the duplicates
                by selecting the menu item View-&gt;Show Selected Records. Then the
                table will only show an updated list of selected records similar to
                the following.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="images/DuplicatesDisplayed.png" name="graphics4" alt="see images in QsoLogViewerHelp.html" align="left" width="522" height="380">
            <br clear="left"/>
            <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In
                this example I clicked on the CALL header in the table to sort them
                by call sign. At this point you should log into your web-hosted or
                local logbook and delete the duplicate records. You may want to
                delete those records not acknowledged by the other operator, when
                possible.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-inside: avoid; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto">
            <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Once you've corrected the
                source logbook you can download a revised AIDF file if the changes
                are extensive. That will prepare you for the next step, identifying
                missing records. Note that when you are only viewing selected records
                the QsoLogViewer title bar will include the term '- Updated List -'.
                This tells you that you are looking at selected records. To return to
                a view of the entire file use the <br/>
                View-&gt;Show All Rows menu
                item.</font></p>
        <h2 class="western"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Step 4 -
                Find and Upload Missing Records</font></h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">To
                find duplicates in an adif file begin by opening the file you
                consider most complete with the</font></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">File-&gt;Open
                menu item. Then select the Action-&gt;Compare Files menu item. The
                file chooser menu will appear asking which file you want to compare
                to the open ADIF file. You may get a warning about duplicate records,
                but you can hit OK to continue. You should then see a dialog similar
                to the one below.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="images/MissingRecordsFound.png" name="graphics5" alt="see images in QsoLogViewerHelp.html" align="left" width="469" height="198">
            <br clear="left"/>
            <br/>

        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In
                this example eight missing records were found. The eight records are
                in the open file, qrz.adi, but not in the compare file, eqsl.adi.
                After you hit the OK button you'll be returned to the main table,
                showing qrz.adi in this example. At that point you will probably want
                to see only selected (highlighted) records. To see them use the
                View-&gt;Show Selected Rows menu item. You should see something like
                the following.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="images/MissingRecordsList.png" name="graphics6" alt="see images in QsoLogViewerHelp.html" align="left" width="519" height="380">

            <font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Look
                these records over and identify any you consider invalid and edit
                those out by selecting them (Cntrl+left click) and then using the
                menu item Edit-&gt;Delete. This action only deletes them from the
                Update List table; it does not affect the AIDF file or any logbook.
                You can now create an update file by selecting the File-&gt;Save menu
                item. I use the naming convention eqsl_update.adi so I am careful to
                only upload updates, not entire logbook AIDF files.</font></p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Once
                you have eliminated duplicates and uploaded missing files your
                logbooks should be synchronized.</font></p>
        <h1 class="western"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Additional
                Menu Items</font></h1>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In
                addition to the menu items already covered, there are two that may be
                helpful.</font></p>
        <h2 class="western">Header Menu Item</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">After opening a file use the View-&gt;File
            Header menu item to display the opened AIDF file's meta data. While
            this can vary, it generally displays which logbook created the file,
            when it was created and which version of the AIDF standard it
            complies with. It will look something like the following.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="images/Header.png" name="graphics7" alt="see images in QsoLogViewerHelp.html" align="left" width="334" height="180">
            <br clear="left"/>
            <br/>
        </p>
        <h2 class="western">Comparison Rules Menu Item</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Qso log records are compared when
            searching for duplicates and when two logbook AIDF files are
            compared. By default QsoLogViewer looks for matches using Call Sign,
            Band, Qso Date and Qso Time On (the UTC time the Qso started). In
            using Qso Time On two times are considered identical if they are
            within a default of 5 minutes of each other. Users can change these
            criteria using the Action-&gt;Show Rules menu item. When selecting
            this menu item you will see the dialog below.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><img src="images/ComparisonRules.png" name="graphics8" alt="see images in QsoLogViewerHelp.html" align="left" width="267" height="447">
            <br clear="left"/>
            <br/>

        </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">When using these fields QsoLogViewer
            ignores case, so the call sign KC1ATT matches with the call sign
            kc1att. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="western">Check All States Menu Item</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Users can check their progress toward
            logging QSOs for all fifty US states by selecting this menu item,
            after loading an ADIF log file. Both QRZ.com and LoTW include the
            home state, QTH, of operators in the schema for their databases.
            eqsl.cc does not include this information, so this menu item will not
            work with log files from that site. When selecting this item a dialog
            box, similar to the one below, will display the results.</p>

                password to the site. Then select the 'Update records' button. You
                may need to wait a few seconds for the session to begin but then
                records should be upgraded at a rate of at least one per second.
                QsoLogViewer will go through every entry and query the grid update
                site for relevant grid information. As the session progresses the
                'No. recs updated' will show how many queries resulted in valid
                gridsquare information.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">A pop up dialog will notify
                you when the update is complete. You then need to close the Update
                Grid Information dialog and then use the 'File-&gt;Save' menu item to
                save the updated file under a new name. </font>
        </p>
        <p><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">If QsoLogViewer fails to
                establish a session with the update site, you will see a dialog pop
                up giving the reason.</font></p>
